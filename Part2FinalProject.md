# User Research Plan

## Goals

My goal is to identify if the maps and data clearly narrate the state of water stress in the countries along the Nile River and the presence of factors that impact the accessibility and availability of water in the region, specifically transboundary disputes.

## Target audience you hope to reach with your story:

I hope to reach the country representatives of the Nile River Initiative and national water resources management planners.

## My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

I selected individuals who I felt would have very little context around the subject matter, but could provide useful feedback due to them being current students or having background in the education field.

## Interview script

### Introductory comments

The Nile River is the longest river in the world, flowing through 11-countries. It is also the only river that flows from south to north. It is a source of livelihood for the over 280 million people living in the countries along its banks and is crucial for the future of the region.

Brief introduction â€“ Hi, my name is Brittany and I am a spatial planner with the UNDP
My goal today is to get your feedback on the maps and data visualizations to get a sense of whether or not they clearly narrate the state of water stress in the countries along the Nile River and the presence of factors that impact the accessibility and availability of water in the region.

### Main section
I have examples of 3 data visualizations that will be used to support the story and call to action. Please respond to the following questions.
What do you think this data is for?
Who do you think the intended audience is?
What are these data visualization telling you?
Is anything surprising or confusing?
What other questions do you have about this site?

### Wrap-up
Thank you for your time. Do you have any questions?

## The findings from my interview

Interview findings are [here}(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_SNk9K-YnmkyaryY4M254xMCv-dgpDMkwsDCJ8vZ_Y/edit?usp=sharing)

## Changes I plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified

I will make sure I have a clear key for all of the charts.

I will use colors that are more intuitive for the map details (i.e. green for resolved and yellow for in-negotiations).

Multiple interview sudjects were confused by the meaning of Water Stress as an indicator in the visualizations, so in my final version I will make sure this is clearly defined.
