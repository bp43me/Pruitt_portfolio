A portfolio of my work in Telling Stories with Data M20

# About me 
Hello! My name is Brittany Pruitt (pronouns: she/hers) I'm a 2nd year MSPPM Global Track and I'm currently taking the course from Adelaide, Australia where CMU-Australia campus is located. I am originally from Stone Mountain, Georgia outside of Atlanta and have spent most of my adult life in the Washington, DC metro area. I love to travel, reading fiction, and coffee.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make my data vizualizations capture my message in a way that is accurate and appealing to the intended audiences. I hope to use some of these new skills at my current internship as I plan to visualize the results of a text analysis I preformed for a pending publication.
