# Final data visualizations decisions

For my final data, the target audience are the Nile Basin Initiative representatives, government officials who develop and influence policy for water resources management for the Nile-basin countries, as well as non-governmental organizations and donors working in the region. From the feedback I received during the user research process, the major changes made to my more intuitive legends and grayed out data on the bar chart or edited the maps to show the countries where the reader should focus their attention. I also decided to use Tableau and Shorthand to create and display my visualizations instead of ArcGIS and StoryMaps. I found it easier to make the multiple visualizations I wanted to use and add the features I wanted to highlight.

## Background on my visualizations

This first map shows the level of water stress across countries in the region and their global rankings out of the 189 countries included. We see Eritrea is in the top 10 of countries with and extremely high level of water stress and Egypt and Sudan have high- water stress. 

In the second map, I wanted to use the bubbles to show which of the countries have been involved in water-related conflict and at what level. It highlights that Egypt has led or been involved in the majority of water-related conflicts and is the only Nile-basin country to have led military level conflict events.

In the bar chart. I am showing the number of treaties over the water stress scores I wanted to answer the question of which extremely high or high-stress Nile-basin countries are involved in a bilateral or regional agreements. From the chart we see that of the countries that are apart of treaties or agreements Eritrea is involved in the least while having the highest water-stress ranking in the region. 

In the final map, I wanted to drill down to show the reader which countries they need to direct their focus too based and the potential for conflict based on their water stress score and their relation to the developments around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. 

Overall, the final data visualizations present the users with a better understanding of the regional water stress level and where potential for water-relate conflict in order to begin exploring opportunities to alleviate water stress, manage water resources sustainably and promote peace and security in the region.
