# Topic: Water stress and transboundary conflict
## Outline

My final project will focus on countries experiencing high water stress and their connection to ongoing transboundary water conflicts in the world. By showing the areas where water stress is most high and identifying conflicts that can contribute to water insecurity efforts for natural resources management and conflict resolutions can be more targeted. The project will take the following approach:

I will present the data visualizations for the countries with the highest baseline water stress and ongoing water conflicts that may be connected.

I will further explain the status of water insecurity in these countries with additional data visualizations on pollution and existing transboundary water management agreements.

The call to action will be for national, regional, and international governing bodies as well as non-governmental organizations to prioritize conflict resolution efforts in these regions as an approach to managing their water stress issues. 

## The data

The data for my visualizations will come from the following sources:

[Transboundary Freshwater Spatial Database and International Freshwater Treaties Database](/https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/data-and-datasets)

“The Transboundary Freshwater Spatial Database contains physical, socioeconomic, and political data relating to the world's international river basins (which is synonymous with watershed and catchment).”

I will use the shapefiles and database of treaties of the transboundary river basins and to create the maps to join them to the water stressed countries.

[Aqueduct Water Stress Projections Data](/https://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/aqueduct-water-stress-projections-data)

The Aqueduct Water Stress Projections Data include indicators of change in water supply, water demand, water stress, and seasonal variability, projected for the coming decades under scenarios of climate and economic growth.

I will use this data to create a map of water stress countries joined to the data on transboundary water conflicts.

## Method and medium

For my visual storytelling, I will be using ESRI’s Story Maps and export my maps to ArcGIS Online for integration. Story maps will allow me to seamlessly display my ArcGIS maps and other visualizations while maintaining their formatting and interactions.
